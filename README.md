# MetaTune

A vue.js application which allows users to upload audio files and view/edit the uploaded files metadata.


## Current Progress
### Current Feature List
- Uploading audio
- Reading attached metadata for uploaded audio
- Editing Song Title, Album, Artist name, and uploading an album art.
- Downloading the saved audio, with the new metadata

### Planned Feature List
- Stylizing the entire thing to actually look good
- Expanding the amount of data, that can be edited
- Downloading the same file type, as the user uploaded. If the user uploads a .flac file, download a .flac file back instead of a .mp3

  
_MetaTune is a work in progress. Stay tuned for future updates!_
